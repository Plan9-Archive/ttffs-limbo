# intro

ttffs is a styx server, serving ttf files in any size as inferno
fonts.  the styx serves serves a seemingly empty directory.  but
walks to files of the form "name.<size>.font" succeed if "name.ttf"
exists and size is numeric > 1.  the file is a normal inferno font
and points to subfonts named "name.<size>.<index>", with index a
numeric index for a glyph range.  these subfonts are also synthesized
by ttffs on demand.

see the manual page for more information and limitations.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- test
- keep track of fid references to Ttfsizes, and drop cached data when last reference goes
- see what Face.index means.  perhaps multiple faces in one ttf file?
- think of generating glyphs for ranges 0x1-0x1f with ascii names drawn
