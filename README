# intro

ttffs is a 9P2000 server, serving ttf files in any size as inferno/plan
9 (sub)fonts.  ttffs serves the file "index", returning a listing
of available fonts.  walks to files of the form
"<name>.<style>.<size>.font" succeed if a ttf file that matches
that description (sanitized name, style, size) exists and size is
numeric > 1.  the file is a normal inferno font and points to
subfonts named "<name>.<style><size>.<index>", with index a numeric
index for a glyph range.  these subfonts are also synthesized by
ttffs on demand.

see the manual page for more information and limitations.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- handle fonts that don't have a glyph 0.  should never crash on glyphs with 0 width/height.
- think of generating glyphs for ranges 0x1-0x1f with ascii names drawn
- generate smaller ranges for big fonts, otherwise we easily run out of memory.
